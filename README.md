# Role Taxonomy Rules

Role Taxonomy Rules is a plugin that lets you define rules for user roles to assign taxonomies when creating new posts

The use case is for a site with specific roles that post to the site. Let's say there's a `sports reporter` role.

When they create a new post on the site, we want it to automatically tag the post with the `sports` category.

With this plugin, we can define rules to make that happen.
